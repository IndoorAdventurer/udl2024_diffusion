# Unsupervised Deep Learning Project Repo
Project Repository for the 2024/2025 Unsupervised Deep Learning course at the University of Groningen

## Project overview
TODO: work out. We want to basically train a diffusion model, but see if we can improve it by taking some inspiration from the GAN-based literature.

## Repository overview
The file structure of this repo is as follows:
- `udl_module/`: a Python package containing most of the code
  - `nn/`: we can play around with different neural network architectures. All PyTorch `nn.Module` objects should go here.
  - `jiri_diffusion/`: Jiri's experiments for training a baseline diffusion model.
  - `vincent_diffusion/`: Vincent's experiments for training a baseline diffusion model.
  - `jiri_gan/`: Jiri's experiments to introduce GAN-based loss into the diffusion model.
  - `vincent_wgan/` Vincent's experiments to introduce Wasserstein-based GAN loss into the diffusion model.
- `notebooks/`: The Jupyter Notebooks we write for training. These should import the `udl_module` code.

## Some ideas to already write down
We can see if a discriminator can discriminate between the diffusion process and the noising process. This means we should give any pair $`\mathbf{z}_t`$ and $`\mathbf{z}_{t+1}`$ as input to the discriminator. We can see if we can create a combined loss function, that is, for example, the average of the diffusion and the GAN loss, and otherwise switch back and forward or something. We will see how it goes ðŸ¤“
